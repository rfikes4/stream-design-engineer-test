# Stream Design Engineer Test

This project was created as part of a design and functionality test for [Stream](https://getstream.io/). It demonstrates my ability to craft innovative, high-quality user interfaces and interactions using modern web technologies.

---

## Project Overview

Iâ€™m always on the hunt for cool designs and interactions to explore and learn from every day. Initially, I conducted a website audit of [Stream](https://getstream.io/) to identify areas for improvement in terms of design and functionality. However, after revisiting the test brief, I decided to take a different approach and used this opportunity to create a unique design inspired by examples from my inspiration library.

For this project, I chose an example shared by [Slava Kornilov](https://x.com/slavakornilov/status/1844337146775339088). I was drawn to its retro-modern style and the inclusion of a concept animation.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The design has been tested and optimized for all major browsers.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Additional styling was added to ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.
- **Custom Assets**: Icons and images were created from scratch using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
- **Frameworks Used**:
  - **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Initially used for rapid styling.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Framework Adjustments**: While Tailwind CSS accelerated initial development, it became overly complex for a highly interactive design. Modular CSS files were introduced to improve organization and readability.
- **Custom Asset Creation**: Building icons and images from scratch ensured that the design matched the retro-modern aesthetic perfectly.
